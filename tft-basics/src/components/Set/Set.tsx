      Every game of TFT takes place in the Convergence, and centers around a specific theme and story called a set.
      Every few months TFT introduces you to a new universe with new champions, traits, and characters to play.
      In terms of gameplay, new sets also come with a new Ranked ladder to climb, new team compositions, and new item possibilities.
